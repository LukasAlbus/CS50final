#### Description: 
For my CS50 Final project I created my personal portfolio website. Where I will be adding projects that I will be creating in the next following months. Which I am very excited. I created this website using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT. 

Technology Used:
I used HTML, CSS and Javascript to create my portfolio. I used tailwind css framework to get a global color pallet on the website and some standard shadows and animations to make the website more concise. 

Website Responsiveness:  
I had to search a lot about how to create a website that would respond well on most devices. It was very difficult to manually adjust css for each device window size and I had to find easier ways to do it. For example creating a class for mobile and applying a global css style for it.

Dark mode and White mode toggle:
I had to create 2 global themes colors, one dark and light mode. To make the toggle work I create a script which has a TurnOnDarkModeColors which would change the color variable to either dark or light.

Glowing object
I created a object which has a glowing effect and follows the cursor. TO do that I create a java script that change the style of the object TOP and LEFT to the same axis of the cursor on the screen. The element is glowing by using css animation, opacity and blur. 

Blog Carrousel 
I used a Framework called Flickity to create the effect of infinite scrolling. I had to adjust sizes and also colors to fit the website style. 

Figma
I used Figma to create the design of the website. I chose a custom font to use to make it even more customizable and also create a hierarchy of font size to make the headlines and paragraphs more cohesive. 

What I learned
I learned a lot about CSS and Javascript. How to use document event listener and how I can make website responsive. I also learned about css frameworks like tailwind. Tail, like bootsrap, are great tools to make the css part faster to work with and also create a standard of what sizes like padding and margins to use. So your website looks more organized.

Difficulties I had
I wanted to create a form in the bottom of the page. For someone to leave their contact there and I receive an email everytime someone does it. But I couldn't make it to work unfortunetly. I think I need to search more about options to do this. The only Options I found were paid.

How to Launch the application
you can run the HTML file on VSCODE with live previews extension. Unfortunetly I dont have this website hosted in any domain yet but I would love to have it soon. I just need to figure out waht to do with the node file that I think are server sided.

Possible Improvements
I would like to get more sections on the webiste and more pages as well.
